# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve **test-uv**. Below you can find guidelines and tips for contributing to the project, including how to set up a development environment, run tests, and generate documentation.


## Developer Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### Setup
```bash title="Install Dependencies"
uv sync --all-groups
```

**NOTE**:
- `--all-groups` installs both the `dev` and `docs` dependency groups.
- If you only want the development tooling (no docs), you can use:
    ```bash
    uv sync --group dev
    ```

### Tasks
All common development tasks like linting, testing, and documentation are defined as [poethepoet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) tasks in `pyproject.toml`.

Here' a quick reference of all available tasks:

| Task         | Description                                                                  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `clean`      | Clean build/test caches and generated artifacts                              |
| `fix`        | Run ruff formatting + lint fixes                                             |
| `check`      | Run ruff (lint + format check), pyright (type-check), and pytest (unit tests)|
| `security`   | Run bandit and pip-audit (security checks)                                   |
| `docs`       | Run zensical (documentation)                                                 |
| `gen`        | Run git-changelog (regenerate CHANGELOG.md from git history)                 |
| `test-pyall` | Run pytest suite across all supported Python versions                        |
| `pre-commit` | Run pre-commit hooks on all files (useful to test after pre-commit failure)  |
| `ci`         | Full suite intended for CI (useful to test after CI failure)                 |
| `release`    | Generate changelog and cut a new release tag                                 |

```bash title="Run Lint, Type-Check, and Unit Tests"
uv run poe check
# or you can install poethepoet and run:
uv tool install poethepoet
poe check
```

### Testing
You should most probably be running `poe check` task, which includes unit tests. In order to run full test suite you can run -

```bash title="Run Full Test Suite"
poe test-pyall
```

This will spawn a separate environment for each supported Python version and run the tests in parallel.

If you want to run tests for a specific Python version, you can run:

```bash title="Run Tests for Specific Python Versions"
poe test-py313
```

### Documentation
Documentation is built using [zensical](https://zensical.org/docs). To build docs locally, run:

```bash title="Build Documentation"
uv sync --group docs
uv run poe docs
```

To serve docs locally with live reload:

```bash title="Serve Documentation Locally"
uv run poe docs-serve
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:8000` where you can view the documentation. Any changes to the docs will trigger an automatic rebuild and refresh in the browser.

### Developer Workflow

Here's how a typical development workflow might look like:

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv sync --all-groups
    ```
2. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks (optional, but recommended):
    ```bash
    uv run pre-commit install
    ```
3. Make your change.
4. Auto-fix formatting + lint issues:
    ```bash
    uv run poe fix
    ```
5. Run the standard checks:
    ```bash
    uv run poe check
    ```
6. If your change touches docs, run:
    ```bash
    uv run poe docs-build
    ```
7. If your change might affect integration behavior, run:
    ```bash
    uv run poe test-integration
    ```
8. If you have added a new dependency, make sure to run:
    ```bash
    uv sync --all-groups
    uv run poe security
    ```
9. If you are happy with changes, cut a new release tag -
    ```bash title="Cut a New Release Tag"
    poe release 0.1.3
    ```
